# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis_FOMC Minutes

## Introduction

This project aims to utilize a large language model(LLM) to extract the official attitudes of the U.S. central bank towards domestic inflation and financial markets from FOMC Minutes. Subsequently, appropriate Markov Switching Models are applied to elucidate the evolving relationship between the two over time. The results indicate that from 2006 to 2023, the relationship between them is...

- **Input**

  Totaling 143 FOMC Minutes documents over 18 years, excerpt content as shown in Figure 1.

   [FOMC minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm)
   ![](/images/FOMCminutes.png "Figure 1")


- **Middle Output**

   Employing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for topic identification within the texts, three representative topics are identified: Economic Outlook, Financial Market, and Inflation. An interactive tool below presents the most frequently occurring words for each topic.



- **Final Output**

  Utilizing the financial-specific language model FinBERT to interpret the sentiment of each topic within the texts. This yields sentiment scores regarding the official attitudes towards each topic from 2006 to 2023. Figure 2 below illustrates the sentiment time series for the year 2021, further refined by a Markov Switching Model to discern the official attitudes towards Financial Market and Inflation.

## Analysis Step

**1. Web Crawler FOMC Minutes documents from the official website**

   - BeautifulSoup
   - Auotomatic

**2. Remove unnecessary texts from the minutes that is not helpful for text information retrival**

   - Participant lists

**3. EDA**

   - numbers regarding the FOMC Minutes

   - Paragraphs and words overtime

       ![](/images/year.png "Figure 4")
     
**4. Convert the data into suitable format**

  - Tokenize

**5. Topic modeling on the text files using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
   
   - Visualization

- **Feature extractor**: In segmentation models, feature extractor layers are used throughout the network, allowing it to process spatial information efficiently. These layers capture local patterns and structures in the input data.

- **Skip Connections**: To recover fine-grained details lost during downsampling, Unet uses skip connections. These connections combine feature maps from early layers with those from later layers, aiding in the reconstruction of high-resolution information.

- **Upsampling**: Segmentation models employ upsampling techniques to restore the spatial resolution of the feature maps. Transposed convolutions or bilinear interpolation can be used for this purpose.
