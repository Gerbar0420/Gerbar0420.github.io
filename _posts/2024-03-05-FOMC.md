# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis_FOMC Minutes(50% ONLY, STILL TRYING THE Statitical algorithm)

## Introduction

After the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve adopted unconventional monetary policies on a large scale, such as forward guidance and quantitative easing (QE). To better understand the Federal Reserve's decision-making process under the new structure, I intend to study the relationship between **inflation** and **financial market**. Thus, this project aims to utilize a large language model to extract the official attitudes of the U.S. central bank towards domestic inflation and financial markets from [FOMC minutes](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm). Subsequently, appropriate Markov Switching Models are applied to elucidate the evolving relationship between the two over time. The results indicate that from 2006 to 2023, the relationship between them is...

- **Input**

  Totaling 143 FOMC Minutes documents over 18 years, excerpt content as shown in Figure 1.

- **Middle Output**

   Employing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model for topic identification within the Minutes, three representative topics are identified: Economic Outlook, Financial Market, and Inflation. Then, utilizing the financial-specific large language model FinBERT to get the sentiment of each topic within the Minutes. This yields sentiment scores (ranged from -1 to 1)regarding the official attitudes towards each topic from 2006 to 2023. Figure 2 below illustrates the sentiment score plot over the studying period

- **Final Output**

  , further refined by a Markov Switching Model to discern the official attitudes towards Financial Market and Inflation.


   

## Analysis Step

**1. Using Web Crawler to get the FOMC Minutes files from the official website**

   - With the assistance of programming, by specifying the range of years for data retrieval, files can be obtained directly from official webpage.
   - Web scraping is particularly crucial for analyzing macroeconomic data, especially in this era of increasingly open data availability.

**2. Remove unnecessary texts from the Minutes that is not helpful for text information retrival**

   - In the initial pages of Minutes typically contain information about attendees' names and affiliated organizations, which are not particularly helpful for sentiment analysis. Therefore, I removed them.

**3. EDA**

   - After preprocessing the Minutes, descriptive statistics regarding the number of paragraphs, sentences, and words are reported.

   - Upon analysis, it is observed that both the number of paragraphs and words show an increasing trend, which aligns with the earlier mentioned use of forward guidance by the Federal Reserve as its policy tool.

**4. Topic modeling on the text files using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
   
   - In a text file, there may encompass more than one topic, as demonstrated in this project where Minutes undergo topic analysis using an LDA model, resulting in three main topics: outlook, financial market, and inflation.
   - Plotting the proportions of each topic over time reveals that the financial market is increasingly mentioned, while conversely, the discussion regarding inflation diminishes proportionally. This trend corresponds with the recent years' stability of inflation being controlled at around 2%.

### Model Building

#### FinBERT

- **Domain-specific Understanding**
  
    FinBERT is trained on financial text data, enabling it to better comprehend financial language nuances.

- **Improved Sentiment Analysis**

  It provides more accurate sentiment analysis of financial texts due to its training on financial news sentiment labels.
  

- **long-term dependencies in text**

  "Utilizing attention mechanisms, bidirectionality, and the Transformer architecture, models like BERT excel in capturing long-term dependencies between words in text."
