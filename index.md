**Hello and Welcome to this blog** 
I'm currently a master student majoring in NYCU Department of Statistics.
I am passionate about capturing the global economy trend by using combination of state-of-the-art AI models and Time series models which is my Master Theses research topic. 
Telling project findings rigorously as well as in a **easy-understanding manner** is the purpose of the Blog.
